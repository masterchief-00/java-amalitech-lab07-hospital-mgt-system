# LAB: Hospital Information System

## Overview

The goal is to design and implement a hospital information system that organizes and manages hospital data efficiently.
It involves entity identification, database schema design, and system integration.

## ERD Overview

The design follows an **Entity-Relationship Model** where:

- **Employees** (doctors and nurses) are generalized under one table.
- Specializations, rotations, and roles are modeled appropriately using separate tables where needed.
- **Patients** are admitted, diagnosed, and tracked over multiple hospital visits.
- Referential integrity is maintained with foreign keys, and historical data (like transfers) is preserved.

## Core Entities

### `admission`

| Field              | Type   | Notes                              |
|--------------------|--------|------------------------------------|
| id                 | SERIAL | Primary Key                        |
| hospitalization_id | INT    | FK to `hospitalization(id)`        |
| ward_id            | INT    | FK to `ward(id)`                   |
| bed_id             | INT    | FK to `bed(id)` (optional)         |

Each new row in `admission` (with same `hospitalization_id`) represents a **transfer** during the same hospitalization.

## The user interface implementation summary

- Simple designs
- The user interface has 2 pages, the main page and the add new patient page.
- Uses error labels, feedback/warning/error alerts, confirmation dialog boxes and <b>Regex expressions</b> to enforce
  input validation along a decent user experience.

## Features implemented

- Create patient
- List all patients
- delete patient
- View patient details
- Search patient by name

## Stack

- Java 21
- JavaFX (Scenebuilder,FXML)
- Maven (for dependency management)

## How to run

- Clone the project
- Open in intelliJ IDEA or another JavaFX-Compatible IDE
- Maven adds dependencies automatically
- Make sure to have a postgres instance running
- create a database, call it `hospital_db` to match the hard coded connection string
- Run the `Main` class
